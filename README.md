# Analytics-Showcase

This repository focuses on managing raw data that goes through a transformation and cleaning process, then analyzed using SQL queries to produce relevant information. The results of the analysis are then distributed into visual dashboards such as Power BI, which display insights based on business needs and common problems. The dashboards built aim to answer business questions, such as evaluating operational performance, identifying sales trends, and monitoring performance based on certain categories or segments.

## Methodology: CRISP-DM

This project adopts the CRISP-DM methodology as a foundational framework:

1. **Business Understanding**  
2. **Data Understanding / Exploratory Data Analysis**  
3. **Data Preparation**  
4. **Modeling** *(optional)*  
5. **Evaluation**  
6. **Deployment (Dashboard Development)**

## Tools & Technologies

- Python (v3.10 / v3.11)  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  
- PostgreSQL & DBeaver  
- Power BI  

## Repository Objective

Beyond showcasing analytical outputs, this repository serves as a learning platform to develop and sharpen technical skills—particularly in **data preprocessing** and **SQL querying** at an   intermediate to advanced level. It includes multiple study cases that implement step-by-step workflows from raw data to final insights. Each case study is accompanied by a `README.md` file that explains the objectives, business context, and final outcomes in detail.
