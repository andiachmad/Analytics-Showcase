## Project Case Understanding

This project uses a cleaned dataset and focuses on learning SQL implementations—especially the use of Window Functions and CTEs—to answer several key questions. Some of the queries created in this project include:

- Average Box Shipped by Product
- KPI Overview
- Monthly Total Revenue
- Trending Product per Month

## Disclaimer

Not all queries and data used in this project are displayed in the dashboard. Some queries are built specifically to enhance understanding and answer analytical questions like “What happened?”. Therefore, several SQL files in this folder are designed for learning purposes and exploring different SQL functions.
