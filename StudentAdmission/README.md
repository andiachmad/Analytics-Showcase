# Student Admission Insight
This project explores a dummy dataset sourced from Kaggle, which simulates data of students applying to a university. The dataset includes key features such as admission test scores and high school GPA averages. Output will be a dashboard provides a clear overview of how students performed in the admission test, how many were accepted, and how the results vary by city or applicant category.

## Project Understanding

The dataset used in this project was intentionally poorly formatted and contains dirty or inconsistent data, as stated by the original contributor. This setup was designed to test and emphasize the importance of data preprocessing. As a result, this project places a strong focus on thorough data cleaning and preparation to ensure the final results are reliable and ready for effective visualization and analysis.
