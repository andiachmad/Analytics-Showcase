### SuperStore Case

This is my first case study project in the Analytical Showcase portfolio, where I began learning and understanding how to leverage data to produce relevant analytical reports. In this project, I explored and identified key columns that could be used to answer business needs, and transformed them into insights visualized using Power BI. The technical workflow I used follows the general approach already outlined in the main README, as most case studies share a similar analysis pattern.

## Project Case Understanding

This project focuses on understanding the integration between each stage of the data pipeline â€” from preprocessing using Anaconda, storing the cleaned data into a local PostgreSQL database (pgAdmin4), and finally visualizing the insights through Power BI dashboards.

## Reflection

As this was my first case study project, I approached it as a learning experience. The folder structure may appear a bit unorganized, with several files such as CleaningData.ipynb and Dashboard Result.png placed directly in the main project directory. Moving forward, I plan to apply better project structuring and file management in future cases.
